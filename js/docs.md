The top section is called the guide. It identifies the pattern that we are going to be using to guess the solution.
The bottom section is the solution space. It's where the user has to attempt to guess the correct pattern.

The game is played by using the guides as a way of correctly identifying each of operations performed on each step.

Types of cards: 
* A blackhole is an element with multiple operation sets

* linear cards: 0 blackholes -- only one possible operation per step. << easiest to solve.
* single: 1 black hole
* multiverse: 2 black holes
* suicide: 3 black holes. << nearly impossible. 

* there's special hacks that people can apply 
- Joker: solves the puzzle.
